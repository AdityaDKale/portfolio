This Python script performs an opening scan for equities listed on the NSE (National Stock Exchange, India). It retrieves pre-open and OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for NIFTY 50 stocks, calculates pivot ranges, and checks whether the pre-open price is greater than R1 or less than S1 pivot levels. The results are saved to an Excel file.
A minimal library for access control. It is designed to be used together with opaque access tokens by providing a simple interface to define roles with different access permissions and verifying requests to resources.
