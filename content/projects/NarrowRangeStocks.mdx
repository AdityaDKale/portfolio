This Python script is designed to perform Narrow Range analysis on a list of stock symbols retrieved from the NSE (National Stock Exchange, India) and save the results to an Excel file. The Narrow Range analysis calculates the percentage difference between the opening and closing prices of a stock for a specified period. If the percentage difference is within a certain threshold (e.g., 1%), the stock is classified as having a "Narrow Range."
